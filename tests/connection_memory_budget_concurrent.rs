//! One connection, one budget, many handles at once.
//!
//! The per-connection memory budget is a single counter shared (cloned `Arc`)
//! by every table opened on a connection. These tests drive several tables at
//! once from separate threads, ingesting and querying, and check that the
//! shared budget holds: usage never crosses the gate, refusals are graceful
//! (`InfinoError::OverBudget`, never a crash or a mislabelled error), and the
//! committed data stays consistent with the appends that were admitted.
//!
//! Ingest is the gating pressure here (each `append` builds a superfile and
//! reserves its build scratch); the concurrent `bm25_search` calls exercise
//! reader + writer handles coexisting on one budget. Reads over local storage
//! are resident, so they don't reserve anything themselves; they just run
//! alongside the ingest.
